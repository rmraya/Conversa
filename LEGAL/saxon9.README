==============================

Saxon-HE 9.9 is the latest major release of the open-source edition of Saxon.

The Saxon 9.9 release is currently considered as the most stable and reliable release.

It is available for the Java and .NET platforms. Releases on C/C++/PHP platforms will be available soon.

The current maintenance release is Saxon-HE 9.9.1.5.

The documentation for Saxon is at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/
and includes a detailed list of changes for each release.

For the Java platform, download file SaxonHE9-9-1-5J.zip.

Installation instructions are at:

http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!about/installationjava

The file saxon-resources9-9.zip contains documentation, sample files, test drivers and other miscellaneous resources. 
It is common to all platforms, and is not normally updated when new maintenance releases appear.

The file saxon9â€“9-1-5source.zip contains source code for both platforms; a new version is produced with each maintenance release. Source code with the latest patches can also be obtained from a Subversion repository maintained at https://dev.saxonica.com/repos/archive/opensource. The Subversion repository on the SourceForge site is no longer maintained.
