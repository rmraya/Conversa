Users should be aware of the following changes in version 1.0.1 of DITA:
* The public ID of tblDecl.mod has been updated. The old, pre-OASIS
  version was accidentally included in the standard. This correct
  public ID is now used in topic.mod and both catalogs:
  "-//OASIS//ELEMENTS DITA 1.0 Exchange Table Model//EN"

* The public ID of map.mod was incorrect in the map.dtd file. The
  correct version (using "ELEMENTS" instead of "Elements") is now
  used in map.mod. It was already correct in both catalogs.
  "-//OASIS//ELEMENTS DITA 1.0 Map//EN"

* The following invalid, pre-OASIS entities were removed:
  ut-d-simpletable in utilitiesDomain.ent
  topicreftypes in map.mod and topic.mod
  conceptClasses in concept.mod
  referenceClasses in reference.mod
  taskClasses in task.mod

* Catalog entries for topicAttr.mod and topicDefn.ent were fixed to
  use the correct file names

* The xml:base attribute was removed from <group> in catalog-dita.xml

* All other changes were corrections to comments

* A full description of the changes is available at:
